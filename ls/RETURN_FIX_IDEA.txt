Whenever you call a sub, store a reference to the next continuation in
the current frame on the call stack, then if anything encounters a
RETURN node, it can simply make its next continuation be the stored
reference.

As for a stop button, I could expand the do_later API to include a
method to unschedule the current setTimeout()'d process() call, and
clear out the event queue.
